abstract
--
The task of a microscopy user is to make observations of their sample and arrive at meaningful conclusions. However, in the current tools, the user has to pass thru many hurdles before meaningful information of their sample is obtained and stored. We aim to create an easy and efficient system for a researcher to carry out experiments, manage projects, instrument time, or share data with others. 

deepthought
--
deepthought is a software suite that builds on top of device abstraction, experiment orchestration and object detection to present online-analysis of the sample.
 
project evolution tools
--
In our system, the user can create branches of projects and experiments as they evolve, which allows for relational representation of the project data which can be used computationally, such as, to get matching information from different projects. With user management and collaboration tools, the project information can be shared with different users and initiate discussions.
