# Introduction

The task of a microscopy user is to observe their sample and arrive at meaningful conclusions. However, in the current tools, the user has to pass thru many hurdles before meaningful information of their sample is obtained and stored. We aim to create an easy and efficient system for a researcher to carry out experiments, manage projects, instrument time, or share data with others.

## deepthought

deepthought is a software suite that builds on top of device abstraction, experiment orchestration and object detection to present multi-dimensional online information of the sample to the user.

## project evolution tools

In the lab, projects and experiments evolve with time. There exists relationships between experiments carried out on different days. This information is unstructured, and structuring it can help manage lab activities better. With user management and collaboration tools, projects can be shared with different users to initiate discussions.
